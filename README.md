# Final_Year_Project_Space_Debris_Catastrophe

### Project Summary:  

Revolution is space science and technology has resulted in several space crafts launched into earthâ€™s orbits. However, with the growing space missions, these valuable natural orbits have become cluttered with artificial debris (Space-Junk), objects that now serve no useful purpose. This project took up a challenge to preserve and maintain a safe and sustainable space environment by developing a solution to tackle the space debris catastrophe. The concerned problem is narrowed down to the most crowded orbit (Low Earth Orbit). The research work is aimed to devise a solution that involves harnessing the natural resources already present in the LEO environment such as Solar Radiation pressure and utilizing the natural cleaning process by the atmospheric drag to perturb the junk objects into the atmosphere and force them to naturally burn up. By using efficient data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms, the classification of thousands of objects into different relevant groups will be accomplished then, using the equations of physics governing the physical laws in the low earth orbit environment, simulation based results will be verified and a physical prototype model will be developed that is needed to be sent as a system installed in satellites to complete the mission.
